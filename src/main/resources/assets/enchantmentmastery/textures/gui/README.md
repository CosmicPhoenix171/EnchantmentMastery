# Mastery Enchanter GUI Texture

This is a placeholder for the GUI texture.
Create a 256x256 PNG file named `mastery_enchanter.png` in this directory.

The layout should be similar to the vanilla enchanting table but modified:
- Background: 176x166 pixels
- Input slot at position (80, 17)
- Enchantment list area: (8, 17) to (116, 97) - 4 entries visible
- Player inventory starting at y=84
- Hotbar at y=142

For development, you can use a vanilla enchanting table texture as a base.
